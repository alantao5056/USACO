## Cross Road

**Reflection**

- When I first did the problem I didn't know the problem that well. I misunderstood it. I thought the number of crossings were when a cow crosses the road twice. Also, I couldn't manage to do the problem becuause it was too hard. 
- But then, after I know that crossing the road counts as 1 cross, I did the problem instantly. 
- I learned that I should always understand the problem correctly before I wrote the code instead of rushing through the problem and misunderstanding it.
