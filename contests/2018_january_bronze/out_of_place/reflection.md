# out of place

- I did this problem for a long time because I was not thinking it the easy way.
- I was always trying to come up with the most efficient way and not taking it the easy way. 
- I need to stop when I was making the problem harder and harder
- If this problem seemed too hard, then try thinking a different way. 
- Try thinking this problem the dumb way, and the most easy way(not complicated way).
- This problem's solution could take a long time if needed.
