# milk measurements

- at first I made the problem more complicated because I didn't read the problem carefully. 
- It says there's only 3 cows, Eessie, Elsie, and Mildred. I thought there could be any name and I have to check if the name in in the hash. 
- I made the problem even harder by making unnessary varibles like greatest milk. 
- Now I know that making the problem harder will make the code confusing and disoroganized.
