# mixing milk

- This problem was really easy because all you needed to do was to pour milk 100 times. 
- the most effecient way is to write a bucket class and add pour as a function in it. 
- After that, all you needed to do was cycle 100 times and pour the milk from 1 bucket to the other.
- Something to improve is to read the input more efficiently.
