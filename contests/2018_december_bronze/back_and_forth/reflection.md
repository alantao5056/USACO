# back and fourth

- I didn't do this problem on first try because I was wrong about something. 
- I did think the problem the easy way and decided to try the possibilities one by one
- The wrong thing I did was after I've poured the milk, I didn't pour it back to try pouring the next one.
- Instead, after pouring one milk, I poured the other one. 
- That made my code wrong and made me confused.
